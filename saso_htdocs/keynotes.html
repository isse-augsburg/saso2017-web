<h2>The Simplicity and Unity Underlying the Complexity of Life from Growth and Innovation to Mortality, Sustainability and the Pace of Life in Organisms, Cities and Companies</h2>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>
Why do all companies and people die whereas cities keep growing and the pace of life continues to accelerate? Why do we stop growing, sleep 8 hours a day and live of the order of 100 years? And how are these related to innovation, wealth creation, social networks, urbanisation and global sustainability? Global urbanisation has emerged as the source of the greatest challenge the planet has faced since humans became social. Cities are simultaneously the hubs of innovation, engines of wealth creation and centers of power, but are also the prime source of crime, pollution, disease, climate change and the consumption of energy and resources. Despite this dual role and the threat to global sustainability, there is no integrated, quantitative, predictive, scientific framework for understanding their dynamics, growth and organization. Ideas for developing such a theory, inspired by a network-based framework for understanding diverse properties of organisms (such as growth, metabolism, cancer, sleep, aging, death, and ecosystems) will be discussed and extended to companies. Despite their extraordinary complexity and diversity, many characteristics of cities and companies, including wages, patents, assets, sales, diversity, crime, police, disease, pollution, and infrastructure, scale systematically and predictably with size suggesting that universal principles that transcend history, geography and culture underlie their dynamics and structure. This has dramatic implications for growth, development and long-term sustainability: left unchecked, innovation and wealth creation that fuel socio-economic systems potentially sow the seeds for collapse.

<h4>Bio</h4>
<p>
Geoffrey West is Distinguished Professor and former President of the Santa Fe Institute, and Associate Fellow of Oxford University’s Martin School. His BA is from Cambridge and PhD from Stanford where he later joined the faculty. West is a theoretical physicist whose primary interests have been in fundamental questions ranging from elementary particles and their interactions to universal scaling laws in biology and developing a science of cities, companies and global sustainability. His work is motivated by the search for “simplicity underlying complexity”. His research includes metabolism, growth, aging & death, sleep, cancer and ecosystems, the dynamics of cities and companies, rates of growth and innovation, and the accelerating pace of life. He has been featured widely across the media including The New York Times, The Economist, Financial Times, Wired, Scientific American, Nova, National Geographic and the BBC. His work was selected as a breakthrough idea by Harvard Business Review (2007) and for Time's 2006 list of "100 Most Influential People in the World".

<h2>Human-machine synergy: Bringing humans and autonomy into balance</h2>

<h4>
  Abstract
</h4>
<p>
 As the systems that we depend on become increasingly autonomous, 
 a critical challenge is to understand how to engineer systems where humans and systems can work together synergistically to achieve their common goals. 
 Adaptive systems research has largely focused on replacing humans with intelligent automation, thereby reducing the cost of operation, the likelihood of human error, and the time to put a course of adaptation into action.  But for many such systems it is not possible or desirable to completely eliminate human involvement in adaptation. In this talk I explore some of the challenges in achieving an appropriate balance, and outline some promising directions that research might take to address these challenges.

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>
With the capabilities of dynamic, real-time and networked automation, distributed energy resources (DER) have become one game-changing driving force to transform electrical power systems into flexible, resilient, cost-effective and greener Cyber-Physical System infrastructure. DERs represent suite of smart-grid assets across value-chain of electricity demand-supply: from distributed renewable generation (solar PV, wind) to electricity storage systems (battery, EV) and flexibility, responsive demand (DR). Meanwhile, with all the advantages and benefits, fast growth of DERs also bring many unseen challenges for utilities and system operators due to the complexities caused by the distributed nature of DER and the diversified business, social, economic and operational objectives of DER owner from both sides of demand and supply. Transactive energy (TE), emerged originally as innovative method to balance electrical demand-and-supply with value-based economic/incentive signal, has become one of smart-grid technology standards to manage various system objectives, constraints and uncertainties in a distributed fashion. Combined with advanced technology from IoT and cloud computing, TE provides an ideal distributed and data/information driven platform to manage and orchestrate DER for utilities and grid operator, and even energy users. The objectives of this talk are 1) to give a brief and informative introduction of current trends and challenges of DER and TE, and 2) to introduce how-to and sample use-cases of Transactive Energy technology to manage DER at large internet-scale in the landscape of ever digitized and data-driven network-connected smart energy grid.
