<h2><a href="http://sasost.socioaware.net/">Fifth International Workshop on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organising Socio-Technical Systems (SASO<sup><small>ST</small></sup>  2017)</a></h2>
<p>The design and operation of computer systems has traditionally been driven by technical aspects and considerations. However, the usage characteristics of information and communication systems are both implicitly and explicitly determined by social interaction and the social graph of users. This aspect is becoming more and more evident with the increasing popularity of social network applications on the internet.
	This workshop will address all social aspects that influence the design of technical systems, covering different perspectives of this exciting research area from the computational modelling of social systems to socio-inspired design strategies for distributed algorithms, collaboration platforms and communication protocols.</p>

<h3>Topics</h3>

<p>SASO<sup><small>ST</small></sup> systems require a highly interdisciplinary approach, and the establishment of a research community around the creation of such systems is one of the workshop's key objectives. For this purpose, the workshop brings together experts from areas such as distributed computer systems, complex systems, and the social sciences to present findings and elaborate on the topic in the following complementary topical sections as well as open panel discussion rounds. Relevant topics include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Computational modelling of social systems
		<ul>
			<li>Trust, norms and reputation management</li> 
			<li>Computational social science techniques</li>
			<li>Social network analysis in information systems and collaboration platforms</li> 
			<li>Information spreading, opinion formation and collective user behaviour</li>
			<li>Real-time prediction of collective phenomena like, e.g., information cascades in social media</li> 
			<li>Representation of and reasoning about computational laws</li> 
			<li>Effects of trust models and metrics on self-organising autonomous systems</li> 
			<li>Analysis of threats to self-organising and autonomous systems</li> 
			<li>Data-driven modelling of human and social aspects in software engineering</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<br/>
	<li>Applications of social aspects in technical systems
		<ul>
			<li>Socio-aware overlays and adaptation of network protocols and topologies</li>

<h2><a href ="http://qa4saso.isse.de/">Fourth IEEE Workshop on Quality Assurance for Self-adaptive, Self-organising Systems (QA4SASO 2017)</a></h2>

<p>Developing self-adaptive, self-organising systems (SASO) that fulfil the requirements of different stakeholders is no simple matter. Quality assurance is required at each phase of the entire development process, starting from requirements elicitation, system architecture design, agent design, and finally in the implementation of the system. The quality of the artefacts from each development phase affects the rest of the system, since all parts are closely related to each other. Furthermore, the shift of adaptation decisions from design-time to run-time - necessitated by the need of the systems to adapt to changing circumstances - makes it difficult, but even more essential, to assure high quality standards in these kind of systems. Accordingly, the analysis and evaluation of these self-* systems has to take into account the specific operational context to achieve high quality standards.</p>

		<p>The necessity to investigate this field has already been recognized and addressed in different communities but there exists so far no platform to bring all these communities together. Therefore, the workshop provides within its third edition an established open stage for discussions about the different aspects of quality assurance for self-adaptive, self-organising systems. Examples for topics of interest are : </p>

		<ul>
			<li>Modelling and verification</li>
			<ul>
				<li>formal models and modelling languages such as automata, state machines, process algebras, logics, HOL, Markov-chains, UML</li>
				<li>run-time verification and validation in self-adaptive, self-organising systems empirical evaluation</li>
			</ul>
			<li>empirical evaluation</li>
			<ul>
				<li>measurement and evaluation of resilience, security, performance, reliability, and cost in self-adaptive, self-organising systems</li>
				<li>benchmarking of self-adaptive, self-organising systems</li>
			</ul>
			<li>test-centred development</li>
			<ul>
				<li>test derivation, test selection, test coverage, test implementation and execution, test result analysis, test oracles, test management, and monitoring</li>
				<li>automated support of any of the testing activities, rigid testing processes, test driven development</li>
			</ul>
			<li>case studies, industrial applications, and experience reports</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The workshop organisers solicit original research papers on the topics outlined in the description with a maximum length of 6 pages. Submitted research papers must not have been previously published or submitted elsewhere. </br>
		Beyond, submissions of fast abstracts are welcome which are not exceeding 2 pages. We encourage the submission of fast abstracts presenting important challenges to future research or position statements on the topics outlined in the description. Fast abstract may also sum-up and present already published work to the workshop community. </br>
		At least two members of the program committee will review each submission in a single-blind process. The decision will be based on the motivation of the topic, the clarity of the contribution, the relevance of the research to the domain of quality assurance for self-adaptive, self-organising systems, its evaluation, and the thoroughness of the related work comparison. 
</p>
		
		<p>The proceedings of the workshop will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press.
		Content will be submitted to the indexing companies for possible indexing. Indexing services are independent organisations, and we cannot guarantee that any particular abstract or index entry will be included in Ei Compendex or any other indexing service.</p>
		
		<p>Each submission will be peer-reviewed by two to three members of the program committee in a single-blind process. The decision will be based on the motivation of the research, the clarity of the claims of the contribution and the relevance of the research to the topics listed above. In particular, submissions that promise to fuel discussions, which bring together results and issues from different disciplines and which thus contribute to the strengthening of an interdisciplinary community will be given preference.</p>
		
		<h3>Aim of the Workshop</h3>
		<p>The workshop aims to bring together researchers of different communities such as Multi-Agent Systems, Autonomic Computing, Organic Computing, 
		Cyber-Physical Systems, Distributed Systems, Runtime Verification, Software Engineering, Software Testing and Software Quality Assurance to 
		discuss - based on research papers, new ideas, and work in progress reports - the different aspects of quality assurance for self-adaptive, self-organising 
		systems in order to provide highly reliable, resilient systems. The workshop is an opportunity to promote different views on this key challenge in self-organising, adaptive 
		systems and to engage in discussions about paradigm shifts in software quality assurance in order to cope the flexibility of the system design of self-organising, adaptive systems, as well as 
		presenting ongoing research and identify areas where more attention from the community is required.  </p>
		
		<h3>Audience</h3>
		<p>The workshop is aimed at researchers and practitioners that have been investigating quality assurance in self-organising, adaptive systems. We explicitly encourage participation of researchers
		from different communities within computer science. The workshop will be set in an informal and cooperative atmosphere with ample time allotted to discussions.</p>

<h2><a href="http://apice.unibo.it/xwiki/bin/view/ECAS2017/">2nd eCAS Workshop on Engineering Collective Adaptive Systems (ECAS 2017)</a></h2>
<p>
Modern software systems are becoming more and more collective, composed of many
distributed and heterogeneous entities. These systems operate under continuous perturbations
making manual adjustments infeasible. For a collective system to be resilient, adaptation must
be collective, that is multiple entities must adapt in a way that addresses critical runtime
conditions while preserving the benefits of the collaborative interdependencies. Decision-making
in such systems is distributed and possibly highly dispersed, and interaction between the
entities may lead to the emergence of unexpected phenomena.
In such systems, a new approach for adaptation is needed to allow (i) multiple entities to
collectively adapt with (ii) negotiations to decide which collective changes are best. Collective
adaptation also raises a second important challenge: which parts of the system (things,
services, people) should be engaged in an adaptation? This is not trivial, since multiple
solutions to the same problem may be generated at different levels. The challenge here is to
understand these levels and create mechanisms to decide the right scope for an adaptation for
a given problem.
This workshop solicits papers that address new methodologies, theories and principles that can
be used in order to develop a better understanding of the fundamental factors underpinning the
operation of such systems, so that we can better design, build, and analyze them, as well as
case studies and applications showing such approaches in action Interdisciplinary work is
particularly welcomed.<p/>
Suggested Topics (but not limited to):
<ul>
<li>Novel theories relating to operating principles of CAS</li>
<li>Novel design principles for building CAS systems</li>
<li>Insights into the short and long term adaptation of CAS systems</li>
<li>Insights into emergent properties of CAS</li>
<li>Insights into general properties of large scale, distributed CAS</li>
<li>Decision-making approaches in CAS</li>
<li>Methodologies for studying, analyzing, and building CAS</li>

<h2><a href="http://dss2017.inn.ac">3rd International Workshop on Data-driven Self-regulating Systems (DSS 2017)</a></h2>
<p>
The emergence of pervasive and ubiquitous technologies together with social media has resulted in unprecedented opportunities to reason about the complexity of our society based on magnitudes of data. Embedded ICT technologies mandate the functionality and operations of several techno-socio-economic systems such as traffic systems, transportation systems, Smart Grids, power/gas/water networks, etc. It is estimated that over 50 billion connected smart devices will be online by the year 2020. Moreover, social media provide invaluable insights about the complexity of social interactions and how these interactions influence the sustainability of several ICT-enabled techno-socio-economic systems. These observations show that regulating online the complex systems of our nowadays digital society is a grand challenge. Regulation concerns trade-offs such as the alignment of technical requirements, e.g. robustness, fault-tolerance, safety and security, with social or environmental requirements, for instance, fairness in the utilization of energy resources. The scale of nowadays data cannot tackle the challenge by itself as data may convey ungrounded correlations and biased predictions. Smart, autonomic and self- regulating mechanisms are required for filtering data streams in real-time and transform them to valuable information based on which intelligent adaptive decisions can be made in a decentralized fashion under a plethora of operational scenarios.
</p>

<p>The aim of the 3rd International Workshop on Data-driven Self-regulating Systems is to foster interactions between researchers of different disciplines working on challenges about the self- organization and self-adaptation of complex techno-socio-economic systems. It also aims to promote communication and exchange of ideas between academia and industry. The workshop will run for a full day and will include (i) keynote speakers, (ii) presentation of papers and (iii) a panel discussion. Panelist may include distinguished researchers who participate in the international research hubs of several international projects such as Nervousnet, SoBigData, ASSET, etc.<p/>

<h2><a href="https://easychair.org/cfp/InSeCo-2017">International Workshop on Industrial Self-Coordination (InSeCo 2017)</a></h2>
<p>
Smart manufacturing, Industry 4.0, Industrial IoT and smart supply chain management systems are some of the core trends that are reshaping the way manufacturing and businesses operate. These technological developments have the potential to significantly improve automation and information exchange in manufacturing. At the same time, researchers and business practitioners are investigating modular structured smart factories to monitor physical processes and to make decentralised decisions. Smart, Industrial Internet of Things systems provide data, for data-driven self-organizing cyber-physical systems, that communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans in real time. The Internet of Services, in both, internal and cross-organizational services are offered and used by participants of the value chain. At the same time, technologies such as those offered by the Distributed Ledger technologies, Smart Contracts and the blockchain concept provide mechanisms for coordination and trust without the need for Trusted Third Parties.
In this workshop we combine broader concepts related to value chains, supply management and manufacturing, with the focus on the blockchain and other emerging technologies for decentralised coordination in the cyber-physical realm.</p>

<h2><a href="https://sissy.ini.rub.de">Fourth International Workshop on Self-Improving System Integration (SISSY 2017)</a></h2>
<p>
Information and communication technology (ICT) pervades every aspect of our daily lives. This inclusion changes our communities and all of our human interactions. It also presents a significant set of challenges in correctly designing and integrating our resulting technical systems. For instance, the embedding of ICT functionality in more and more devices (such as household appliances or thermostats) leads to novel interconnections and a changing structure of the overall system. Not only technical systems are increasingly coupled, a variety of previously isolated natural and human systems have consolidated into a kind of overall system of systems - an interwoven system structure.
</p>
<p>
This change of structure is fundamental and affects the whole production cycle of technical systems - standard system integration and testing is not feasible any more. The increasingly complex challenges of developing the right type of modelling, analysis, and infrastructure for designing and maintaining ICT infrastructures has continued to motivate the self-organising, autonomic and organic computing systems community.
</p>
<p>In this workshop, we intend to study novel approaches to system of
system integration and testing by applying self-* principles;
specifically we want approaches that allow for a continual process of
self-integration among components and systems that is self-improving
and evolving over time towards an optimised and stable solution.
</p>
<p>Although research in self-organising systems - such as the Organic
Computing (OC) and Autonomic Computing (AC) initiatives - has seen
an exciting decade of development, in which there has been
considerable success in building individual systems, OC/AC is faced
with the difficult challenge of integrating multiple self-organising
systems, and integrating self-organising systems with traditionally
engineered ones as well as naturally occurring human
organisations. Meanwhile, although there has been important
development in system of systems methodologies (e.g., Service-oriented
Architectures, clouds technology etc.), many of these developments
lack scalable methods for rapidly proving that new configurations of
components/subsystems are correctly used or their changes verified or
that these frameworks have pulled together the best possible
context-sensitive configuration of resources for a user or another
system.</p>
<p>
The SISSY workshop continues the successful predecessors held at IEEE
International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organising Systems
(SASO14) 2014 in London, UK, IEEE/ACM International Conference on
Autonomic Computing (ICAC15) 2015 in Grenobles, France, and at
IEEE/ACM International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC16) 2016
in Würzburg, Germany. The workshop intends to focus on the important
work of applying self-X principles to the integration of "Interwoven
Systems" (where an "Interwoven System" is a system cutting across
several technical domains, combining traditionally engineered systems,
systems making use of self-X properties and methods, and human
systems). The goal of the workshop is to identify key challenges
involved in creating self-integrating systems and consider methods to
achieve continuous self-improvement for this integration process. The
workshop specifically targets an interdisciplinary community of
researchers (i.e. from systems engineering, complex adaptive systems,
socio-technical systems, and the OC/AC domains) in the hope that
collective expertise from a range of domains can be leveraged to drive
forward research in the area.</p>
