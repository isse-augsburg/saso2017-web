<h2>
Doctoral Symposium on Foundations and Applications of Self-* Systems (FAS*W)
</h2>-


<p>
Foundations and Applications of Self* Systems (FAS*) is the umbrella for two closely related but independent conferences, the International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO) and the International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing (ICCAC). The FAS* Doctoral Symposium provides an international forum for PhD Students working in research areas addressed by FAS*. In this forum, PhD students will get unique opportunities to subject their research to the scrutiny of external experts, gain experience in the presentation of research, connect to peers and experts addressing similar problems, and get advice from a panel of internationally leading researchers. Different from the technical tracks of the conference, the FAS* Doctoral Symposium focuses on the specific needs of young researchers at the beginning of their career. As such, emphasis will be placed on a critical and constructive feedback that shall help participants to successfully conclude their PhD studies.
</p>

<p>
PhD students working in any area addressed by the FAS* conferences are invited to submit a Doctoral Symposium paper in which they describe the key motivation and objectives of their research project, and reflect on the methodology as well as the current status of their PhD studies. Complementing the thematic focus of FAS*, we particularly solicit contributions in the following areas:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Engineering of self-organizing and self-adaptive systems</li>

<li>Complex cyber-physical and socio-technical systems</li>

<li>Self-* approaches in massive-scale decentralized systems</li>

<li>Application of self-* in robotics and spatial computing</li>

<li>Autonomic and cloud computing</li>

<li>Scalable and applied machine learning / Data mining</li>

</ul>

<h2>
Submission Instructions
</h2>

<p>
Submissions should have a length of max. two pages (not including references) and be formatted
according to the IEEE Computer Society Press proceedings style guide. Authors should submit
their papers using the EasyChair installation of the main conference, which is available at:
</p>

<p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saso2017">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saso2017</a>
</p>

<p>
Please note that only single-author submissions are accepted, which focus on the topic of the doctoral work. The name of the supervisor should be clearly marked below the author’s name in the paper. Submissions should further adhere to the following structure:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Motivation: motivate the open problem that you want to address and briefly summarize existing approaches along with their deficiencies.</li>
<li>Objectives: describe the key objectives of your PhD project and argue how achieving them will solve the open problem outlined in the motivation.</li>
<li>Methodology: outline what methodology you will adopt to meet the objectives of your project. Clearly state on what existing works your work will build.</li>
<li>Research Plan: describe what preliminary results – if any – you have already achieved and summarize your plans for future work. Please add a rough schedule that allows to judge whether your research plan is feasible.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Authors of accepted papers shall prepare a final, camera ready version of the paper, taking into account all feedback from reviewers, and formatted according to the IEEE Computer Society Press proceedings style guide. Doctoral Symposium papers will be advertised in the final program, and will be submitted to IEEE Xplore as part of the SASO proceedings. Papers will also be made available in the IEEE Digital Library.
</p>

<h2>
Review Process
</h2>

<p>
Each submission will be reviewed by at least two Doctoral Symposium experts that cover the different areas of interest of the conference. Submissions will be evaluated based on their relevance, the motivation and quality of the proposed research, as well as the suitability of the chosen methodology.
</p>

<p>
Authors of accepted papers will have different opportunities to present their project at the conference. Besides a full presentation during the PhD Symposium session, an “Elevator Pitch Session” will be organized during the main conference, where authors get the chance to briefly showcase their research. In addition, the Best Doctoral Symposium paper will be selected and the award will be presented during the main conference. Finally, selected authors will have the additional chance to present their work via a poster in the poster session of the main conference.
