<h1>Call for Papers</h1>

<h2>
Aims and Scope
</h2>

<p>
The aim of the Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing systems conference series (SASO) is to provide a forum for the foundations of a principled approach to engineering
systems, networks, and services based on self-adaptation and self-organization. The complexity of current and emerging networks, software, and services, especially
when dealing with dynamics in the environment and problem domain, has led the software engineering, distributed systems, and management communities to look for
inspiration in diverse fields (e.g., complex systems, control theory, artificial intelligence, sociology, and biology) to find new ways of designing and managing
such computing systems. In this endeavor, self-organization and self-adaptation have emerged as two promising interrelated approaches. They form the basis for
many other self-* properties, such as self-configuration, self-healing, or self-optimization. Systems exhibiting such properties are often referred to as self-* systems.
</p>

<p>
The tenth edition of the SASO conference embraces the inter-disciplinary nature and the scientific, empirical, and application dimensions of self-* systems and welcomes
novel results on both self-adaptive and self-organizing systems research. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
</p>

<ul>
	<li> Systems theory: theoretical frameworks and models; biologically- and socially-inspired paradigms; inter-operation of self-* mechanisms;</li>
	<li> Systems techniques: techniques to specify and analyze self-* systems, like statistical physics, machine learning, multi-agent systems, or other novel techniques;</li>
	<li> Systems engineering: reusable mechanisms, design patterns, architectures, methodologies; software and middleware development frameworks and methods, platforms</li>
and toolkits; hardware; self-* materials; governance of self-* systems, emergent behavior in self-* systems;
	<li> System properties: robustness, resilience, and stability; emergence; computational awareness and self-awareness; reflection; anti-fragility;</li>
	<li> Cyber-physical and socio-technical systems: human factors and visualization; self-* social computers; crowdsourcing and collective awareness; human-in-the-loop;</li>
	<li> Data-driven approaches: data mining; machine learning; data science and other statistical techniques to analyze, understand, and manage behavior of complex systems;</li>
	<li> Education: experience reports; curricula; innovative course concepts; methodological aspects of self-* systems education;</li>
	<li> Ethics and Humanities in self-* systems;</li>
	<li> Applications and experiences with self-* systems in any of the following domains:
		<ul>
			<li>Smart-*: application of self-* principles to smart-grids, smart-cities, smart-environments, smart-vehicles</li>
			<li>Industrial automation: embedded self-* systems, adaptive industrial plants, smart industries (Industry 4.0) </li>
			<li>Transportation: autonomous vehicles, coordination between vehicles, pedestrians, and infrastructure, and traffic optimization</li>
			<li>Unmanned systems: aerial vehicles, undersea vehicles, other robotic platforms</li>
			<li>Internet of Things: challenges, applications, and benefits; self-* for network management, self-* applied to Cybersecurity</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
We are looking for contributions that present novel theoretical or experimental results, novel design patterns, mechanisms, system architectures, frameworks or tools, or practical approaches and experiences in building or deploying real-world systems and applications. Contributions contrasting different approaches for engineering a given family of systems, or demonstrating the applicability of a certain approach for different systems, are equally encouraged. Likewise, papers describing substantial innovation or insights in the use and communication of self-* systems in the classroom are welcome.
</p>

<p>
Where relevant and appropriate, accepted papers will also be encouraged to participate in the Demo or Poster Sessions.
</p>

<h2>
Submission Instructions
</h2>

<p>
Submissions can be up to 10 pages, formatted according to the standard IEEE Computer Society Press proceedings style guide, and submitted electronically in PDF format.
Please register as authors and submit your papers using the SASO 2016 conference management system at:
</p>
<p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saso2016">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saso2016</a>.
</p>
<p>
The proceedings will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press, and made available as a part of the IEEE Digital Library. Note that a separate Call for Poster and Demo Submissions
will also be issued.
As per the standard IEEE policies, all submissions should be original, i.e., they should not have been previously published in any conference proceedings, book, or journal and should not currently be under review for another archival conference. We also highlight IEEEâ€™s policies regarding plagiarism and self-plagiarism (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/ID_Plagiarism.html">http://www.ieee.org/.../ID_Plagiarism.html</a>).
</p>

<h2>
Review Criteria
</h2>

<p>
Papers should present novel ideas in the cross-disciplinary research context described in this call, motivated by problems from current practice or applied research. Both theoretical and empirical contributions should be highlighted, substantiated by formal analysis, simulation, experimental evaluations, comparative studies, and so on. Appropriate references must be made to related work. Because SASO is a cross-disciplinary conference, we encourage papers to be intelligible and relevant to researchers who are not members of the same specialized sub-field.
</p>
<p>
Authors are also encouraged to submit papers describing applications. Application papers should provide an indication of the real world relevance of the problem that is solved, including a description of the deployment domain, and some form of evaluation of performance, usability, or comparison to alternative approaches. Experience papers are also welcome, especially if they highlight insights into any aspect of design, implementation or management of self-* systems that would be of benefit to practitioners and the SASO community. 
All submissions will be rigorously peer reviewed and evaluated on the basis of the quality of their technical contribution, originality, soundness, significance, presentation, understanding of the state of the art, and overall quality.
