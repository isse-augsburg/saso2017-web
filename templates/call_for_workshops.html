<h1>Call for Workshops</h1>

<p>
  <em>The accepted workshops can be found <a href="workshops.html">here</a>.</em>
</p>

<p>
The FAS* 2016 Steering Committee invites proposals for the Workshop Program to be held along with the technical conferences SASO 2016 and ICCAC 2016. FAS*W workshops will provide a meeting for presenting novel ideas in a less formal and possibly more focused way than the conferences themselves. Their aim is to stimulate and facilitate active exchange, interaction, and comparison of approaches, methods, and ideas related to specific topics, both theoretical and applied, in the general area of Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems as well as Cloud and Autonomic Computing. To motivate the discussion and participation of all the workshop attendants, we encourage organizers to get away of the typical "mini-conference" format of a workshop, and include more discussion sessions, panels, etc. Members from all areas of the SASO and ICCAC communities are invited to submit workshop proposals for review. Workshops on global challenges, applications or on new and emerging topics are particularly encouraged. Workshops can vary in length, but most will be one full day in duration. Optionally, if desired by the organizers, workshop proceedings can be published through IEEE. Attendance of workshops will be included in the registration fee for the main SASO/ICCAC conference.

  <li>complementarity with the conference topics,</li>
  <li>balance and distinctness of workshop topics, and </li>
  <li>the capacity of the conference workshop program.</li>
</ul>
Note that authors of proposals addressing similar and/or overlapping content areas and/or audiences may be requested to merge their proposals.
