The 2017 edition of the SASO conference series will be held at the University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ in the week of September 18-22, 2017.
SASO is part of FAS*,
a common umbrella for two closely related but independent conferences (SASO and ICCAC)
with shared events including workshops, tutorials, doctoral symposia, etc.

                    The aim of the Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing systems conference series (SASO) is to provide a forum for the foundations of a principled approach to engineering systems, networks and services based on self-adaptation and self-organization. The complexity of current and emerging networks, software and services, especially in dealing with dynamics in the environment and problem domain, has led the software engineering, distributed systems and management communities to look for inspiration in diverse fields (e.g., complex systems, control theory, artificial intelligence, sociology, and biology) to find new ways of designing and managing such computing systems. In this endeavor, self-organization and self-adaptation have emerged as two promising interrelated approaches. Many significant research problems exist related to self-adaptive or self-organizing systems. A challenge in self-adaptation is often to identify how to change specific behavior to achieve the desired improvement. Another major challenge is to predict and control the global system behavior resulting from self-organization. Yet more challenges arise from the confluence of self-adaptation with self-organization. For instance, how do self-* mechanisms that work well independently operate in combination? How are meso-level structures formed which leverage micro-level behavior to achieve desirable macro-level outcomes, and avoid undesirable ones?<br/><br/>
					The 11th edition of the SASO conference embraces the inter-disciplinarity and the scientific, empirical and application dimensions of self-* systems; it thus aims to attract participants with different backgrounds, to foster cross-pollination between research fields, and to expose and discuss innovative theories, design principles, frameworks, methodologies, tools, and applications.

                    <h1>Remote Attendance</h1>
                    <strong>
                    This year's conference is scheduled to take place in the United States. We recognize that due to the current or potential future actions of the United States government, some people may be unable or fearful to attend. We have considered moving the conference to another country, but recognize that that will not resolve the situation, as some people may likewise be unable to safely leave the United States. Therefore, for any person who wishes to participate but is unable to do so due to the travel restrictions imposed by the United States government, we will be offering a "remote attendance" registration at a discounted rate, to be announced at a later point in time. Authors with accepted papers will be able to present their work remotely, complying with IEEE presentation requirements, and we are investigating videoconferencing solutions for streaming to remote attendees.
