<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>
Why do all companies and people die whereas cities keep growing and the pace of life continues to accelerate? Why do we stop growing, sleep 8 hours a day and live of the order of 100 years? And how are these related to innovation, wealth creation, social networks, urbanisation and global sustainability? Global urbanisation has emerged as the source of the greatest challenge the planet has faced since humans became social. Cities are simultaneously the hubs of innovation, engines of wealth creation and centers of power, but are also the prime source of crime, pollution, disease, climate change and the consumption of energy and resources. Despite this dual role and the threat to global sustainability, there is no integrated, quantitative, predictive, scientific framework for understanding their dynamics, growth and organization. Ideas for developing such a theory, inspired by a network-based framework for understanding diverse properties of organisms (such as growth, metabolism, cancer, sleep, aging, death, and ecosystems) will be discussed and extended to companies. Despite their extraordinary complexity and diversity, many characteristics of cities and companies, including wages, patents, assets, sales, diversity, crime, police, disease, pollution, and infrastructure, scale systematically and predictably with size suggesting that universal principles that transcend history, geography and culture underlie their dynamics and structure. This has dramatic implications for growth, development and long-term sustainability: left unchecked, innovation and wealth creation that fuel socio-economic systems potentially sow the seeds for collapse.

<h4>
  Abstract
</h4>
<p>
 As the systems that we depend on become increasingly autonomous, 
 a critical challenge is to understand how to engineer systems where humans and systems can work together synergistically to achieve their common goals. 
 Adaptive systems research has largely focused on replacing humans with intelligent automation, thereby reducing the cost of operation, the likelihood of human error, and the time to put a course of adaptation into action.  But for many such systems it is not possible or desirable to completely eliminate human involvement in adaptation. In this talk I explore some of the challenges in achieving an appropriate balance, and outline some promising directions that research might take to address these challenges.

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>
With the capabilities of dynamic, real-time and networked automation, distributed energy resources (DER) have become one game-changing driving force to transform electrical power systems into flexible, resilient, cost-effective and greener Cyber-Physical System infrastructure. DERs represent suite of smart-grid assets across value-chain of electricity demand-supply: from distributed renewable generation (solar PV, wind) to electricity storage systems (battery, EV) and flexibility, responsive demand (DR). Meanwhile, with all the advantages and benefits, fast growth of DERs also bring many unseen challenges for utilities and system operators due to the complexities caused by the distributed nature of DER and the diversified business, social, economic and operational objectives of DER owner from both sides of demand and supply. Transactive energy (TE), emerged originally as innovative method to balance electrical demand-and-supply with value-based economic/incentive signal, has become one of smart-grid technology standards to manage various system objectives, constraints and uncertainties in a distributed fashion. Combined with advanced technology from IoT and cloud computing, TE provides an ideal distributed and data/information driven platform to manage and orchestrate DER for utilities and grid operator, and even energy users. The objectives of this talk are 1) to give a brief and informative introduction of current trends and challenges of DER and TE, and 2) to introduce how-to and sample use-cases of Transactive Energy technology to manage DER at large internet-scale in the landscape of ever digitized and data-driven network-connected smart energy grid.

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>
The institutions that structure our lives vary wildly in their
complexity and level of formality. Environment, size, and structure
are likely to be related across the range of self-governing
communities, but a truly general understanding of institutional
development requires access to large numbers of communities that are
broadly comparable but still heterogeneous. We compare 80,000
amateur-run online web server communities to examine the relationship
between resource management challenges, community success, and regime
complexity. While these communities cover a range of sizes from
2–20,000 visitors, their administrators are united by goal of building
a successful community, and the common challenges that come with that.
We find that regimes in larger self-governing communities have more
developed governance regimes, as measured by scope, intensity,
specialization, and consolidation of authority. A comparative
understanding successful self-governance contributes to theories of
institutional design that can cover the widest variety of social
systems: businesses and book clubs, trade treaties and town halls.

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>
In the recent past we've heard a lot about the Wisdom of Crowds, Swarm Intelligence and things of that nature: the more the merrier, let's say. We're quite happy in many of our models to actively seek out and ignore the outliers, for whatever reason makes sense to us.

And that's okay. But.

Bellwethers exist. People have different views. Quite often, the swarm is the extension of an individual will. There are many different ways crowds work. More importantly, there are many different views in societies. Tolerance is about not just accepting but embracing these differences. This, we argue, adds strength, resilience, adaptability to socio-technical systems. But we need to think about that when we are building our models.

In this talk. Let's explore that.

Steve Marsh is a Trust Scientist and a thought leader in the phenomenon of trust for computational systems. He is an Assistant Professor of Information Systems in the Faculty of Business and Information Technology, University of Ontario Institute of Technology.

His PhD (University of Stirling, 1994) was a seminal work that introduced the first formalisation of the phenomenon of trust (the concept of 'Computational Trust'), and applied it to Multi Agent Systems. As a milestone in trust research, it brought together disparate disciplines and attempted to make sense of a vital phenomenon in human and artificial societies, and is still widely referenced today, being in the top tenth of one percent of Citeseerx's most cited articles in computer science. Steve's current work builds extensively on this model, applying it to network security, Critical Infrastructure Protection, and mobile device security.

His research interests include computational trust, computational wisdom, device comfort, trust management, regret and regret management, and socially adept technologies. He is the Canadian delegate to IFIP Technical Committee 11: Security and Privacy Protection in Information Processing Systems. He is an adjunct professor at UNB (Computer Science) and Carleton University (Systems and Computer Engineering and Cognitive Science).

Steve lives in rural Ontario, Canada with dogs, cats, horses and people, all of whom have their own things to teach us about trust.
