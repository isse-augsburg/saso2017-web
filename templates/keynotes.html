  Abstract
</h4>
<p>
Achieving fast and accurate collective decisions with a large number of simple agents without relying on a central planning unit or on global communication is essential for developing complex collective behaviours. In this talk, I will overview recent research done in my lab on collective decision making in robot swarms. In particular, I will present ad hoc and opinion-based methods for the solution of a few variants of the best-of-n problem. I will discuss the results of real robot experiments and show how different types of modelling techniques can help us understanding the dynamics of the swarm collective decisions.

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>
Many services, such as healthcare and education are highly human-intensive offerings that remain inaccessible (at acceptable quality level) to large numbers of people. With increasing digitization of the world and easy availability of computational power over the cloud, there is an opportunity to apply data science to transform these services. We begin by describing a dire need and an opportunity to improve the healthcare system worldwide by supporting a shift from reactive treatment to more proactive action. As examples of what is possible, we present new machine learning techniques to predict a class of complications in an ICU, and to identify patients in a hospital who are likely to require ICU admission. We also present work that shows the applicability of remote sensing and data analytics to measure body vitals such as respiration and heart rate, to screen for diseases, and to reduce the need for people to visit a hospital. We then describe a cloud-hosted system called TutorSpace to help with personalization and improved navigation of videos from massive open online courses to enable more effective learning. Finally, we present data-driven techniques to improve public transportation services and to enable cities to reduce traffic congestion while offering a range of transportation options to their citizens. We frame all of the above efforts as examples of using data science and cloud to offer personalized services at scale. We describe some outstanding challenges that need to be met to achieve truly transformational impact.

<h2>Future of Robotics – Paving the Way for a Generation ‘R’ of Robotic Natives in the Age of Digitalization</h2>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>
Humankind is facing disruptive technological innovation, e.g., in the fields of robotics, automation and artificial intelligence. These changes will prove to have at least as much impact on society over the next half a century as the Internet and mainstream IT technology had over the last 50 years. As we are facing a great chance of addressing possibly arising issues in advance – involving self-regulation in the sense of Technology Governance – these challenges have to be discussed on a broad, fact based and interdisciplinary level. The talk will discuss the future of robotics, automation and artificial intelligence. It will explain, why our grandchildren will grow up as the first Generation ‘R’ of Robotic Natives and suggest the concept of Technology &amp; Robotic Governance as a means of self-regulation when dealing with these disruptive technologies. It will also touch the importance of self-organization and self-adaption as enabling technologies for autonomous robotic systems.
